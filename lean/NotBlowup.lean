Two elementary arithmetic identities, used as a worked illustration (not a theorem about
Navier–Stokes solutions). If the vorticity sup-norm is a constant `M`, the BKM integral over
`[0,T]` is `M * T`, which is finite, while the quadratic history `∫₀ᵀ M² dt = M * M * T` still grows
linearly in `T`. So linear growth of the history does not, by itself, signal BKM blow-up.
Both statements hold by `rfl`; they are definitions unfolded, not analysis.
This does not prove or disprove Fefferman (C) or (D).
